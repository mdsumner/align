Description: A single core object for grid specification defined by dimension
    and extent. Resolution, coordinates, cell indices, and row/column mappings
    are derived on demand by arithmetic. Crop, expand, resize, and tile
    operations produce new specs on the same lattice. Pure index arithmetic,
    no data, no I/O.
